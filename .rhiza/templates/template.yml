# Rhiza Template Configuration
# ============================
# This file controls which template bundles are synced to your project.
# 
# Available Template Bundles:
# ---------------------------
# core         - Core Rhiza infrastructure (always included automatically)
# legal        - LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
# tests        - pytest, coverage, type checking, security scanning, CI workflows
# benchmarks   - Performance benchmarking with pytest-benchmark (recommends: tests)
# docker       - Docker containerization with Dockerfile and workflows
# marimo       - Interactive Marimo notebooks for data exploration
# book         - Documentation generation with pdoc, coverage, and test reports (requires: tests)
# devcontainer - VS Code DevContainer for consistent development environments
# gitlab       - GitLab CI/CD pipelines (alternative to GitHub Actions)
# presentation - Reveal.js presentation building (recommends: marimo)
#
# Usage:
# ------
# Option 1: Template-based (recommended)
#   Select pre-configured bundles that automatically include all related files
#
# Option 2: Path-based (advanced)
#   Specify individual file patterns for fine-grained control
#
# Option 3: Hybrid
#   Combine both approaches - templates for common features, paths for customization
